## Contrast-Based Trend Visualization

Open-source Python utilities for visualizing contrast-based
dose–response trends derived from repeated-measures
mixed-effects models.

### Features
- Estimated marginal means with 95% confidence intervals
- Linear and quadratic contrast projection
- Visualization aligned with mixed-model outputs (e.g., SPSS)
- Publication-ready figures for scientific reporting

### Intended Use
This package is intended for visualization only.
Statistical inference should be conducted using appropriate
mixed-effects modeling software.

### Example
```bash
python examples/example_rmssd_puffing.py
